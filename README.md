# Minube - Frontend Test


## Before you begin
### Purpose of the test
The purpose of the test is to evaluate a candidate’s technical abilities.

### Criteria
The evaluation will take into account the following criteria:
- Cleanliness of code
- Problem-solving ability
- Re-use of code
- Attention to detail
- Level of completion
- Simplicity of the solution
- Tests

## How the test works
Fork this repository and start working on your solution trying to commit as much as possible (every small step you fix ideally), to check your progress. Please make a first commit changing something on README.md as time stamp.

You can start when you can but take into account that the test has been designed to be done in less than 4 hours by a senior developer. Once the 4 hours have finished, push your solution and send an email with the URL of your repository to jobs@minube.com with the subject ``[JOB][Frontend] John Doe`` if you name is John Doe :P

Projects can be submitted before the 4 hour limit if they are completed. If a project is not completed during the 4 hours available, the candidate should submit all code completed during the test. Once the test is complete, the candidate is free to complete the project and submit it again with no time restrictions.

## Requisites
- The candidate should use his/her own development/testing platform.
- It should be functional and equal across all modern browsers.
- Candidates should submit instructions for executing the code (these can be submitted after the test period is over)
- Candidates must use a CSS preprocessor
- Candidates must use a templating system
- The solution should be SEO-friendly
- The candidate should adapt the design so that it’s responsive between 320px and 768px (it’s not necessary to appear correctly in desktop).
- Take into account that our stack is mainly PHP

## The test
At the International Train Lovers Association, we want to create a website that allows us to save the train stations we visit. The association's members haver compiled 1098 train stations around the world, and a software developer friend has created a small interface that allows us to search stations and indicate the ones we've visited with a heart symbol.

Given the sheer amount of stations, they are grouped by cities so that it they are easier to search. And, if you only want to focus on one country, you also have the option to view cities by country.

Although our developer friend used Avenir font, us train lovers prefer Merriweather and we'd like you to use this font.

Next, we'll explain how we'd like our website.

### Mockups
![mockup](https://imgs-akamai.mnstatic.com/tools/tests/frontend/mockup.png)

- Upon entering, the principal destinations with train stations are shown.
- These destinations can be filtered by country using a menu available in the filter button in the top right corner..
- When a city is clicked, a map is shown.

![mockup2](https://imgs-akamai.mnstatic.com/tools/tests/frontend/mockup2.png)

- Upon entering a city, all stations in that city are shown.
- In the upper right corner there is an icon that opens a menu with the stations in that city.
- The user can mark a station as visited with a heart.
- The marked stations should be maintained during various browsing sessions from the same device, without using server databases.
- The marked stations should be shown on the map in a different color.
- The user should be able to unmark a station.
- If a station has been previously marked, it should appear marked in red when the user enters that city.

## Url for API request for list of all stations:
``https://gist.githubusercontent.com/inakivb/943ed6b3a8bcc667c1e1147b7591e32f/raw/355b2d67aaea30fd322c7d1e1a8660480609d67a/stations.json``

## Graphic resources

### Structure of image URLs:
`https://imgs-akamai.mnstatic.com/{chars 0-1}/{chars 1-2}/{hashcode}.jpg?output-quality=75&output-format=progressive-jpeg&interpolation=lanczos-none&fit=around%7C{WIDTH}%3A{HEIGHT}&crop={WIDHT}%3A{HEIGHT}%3B*%2C*`

Given the image hashcode **88380e61d8cc9ba87a107bebe60fc6df** , to get a 183x90px crop, the URL should be structured in the following way:
```
88   38  0e61d8cc9ba87a107bebe60fc6df
 |   |
 L{chars 0-1}
     |
     L{chars 1-2}
```

)


## How to run

### Installing

First, you have to install npm packages used in the project. So, you have to run the next command in the root of directory

```
npm install
```

You have to specify an Api Key of Google Maps in /app/env.js to run the maps.


```
module.exports = {
  apiKey: 'AIz*************************A'
}
```

Now the app is ready to run with the command

```
npm start
```

This command runs [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) generating the files into the folder /dist/. To run the application you have to open /dist/index.html

### Running the tests

Several unit test have been done for this project. The tests are running under [Jasmine](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html) and you have to run the next command to execute them

```
npm test
```
